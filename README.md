# Inventory Management System
I have created an application that simulates a store's inventory management.

This application uses 4 different Design Patterns, which are:
- Factory Pattern
- Observer Pattern
- Singleton Pattern
- Command Pattern

## Design Patterns

### Factory Pattern
- Used in product creation since all products have different messages when they are added and when an order arrives.

### Observer Pattern
- Used when restocking products so that the correct product is restocked based on the supplier.

### Singleton Pattern
- Ensures that there is only one inventory per application/company.

### Command Pattern
- Used in both the Main Menu and the sorting menu to choose between QuickSort and MergeSort. This allows the menu to be expanded and more sorting algorithms to be added.

## Algorithms

- **QuickSort and MergeSort**
  - I believe that QuickSort is the fastest. Both used to sort the inventory by name, quantity or price.

- **Binary Search**
  - Additionally, I created a search algorithm. This is the fastest search algorithm but requires a sorted list.
